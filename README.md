  <summary>My story</summary>
<br>  
  
üìÖ **2013 - 2019**  
  
I started learning programming at the university.
At first I worked on developing algorithmic thinking and wrote simple programs using [Kumir](https://www.niisi.ru/kumir/) system.

My first real programming language was C. Learning C evolved into learning C++. I trained on console applications. Two of them left in my repos: [Array Range Analyzer](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/array-range-analyzer) and [Snake Case Variable](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/snake-case-variable).

Then I moved to UI applications based on QT framework.
Several examples have survived in my archive repos: [Turing Machine](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/turing-machine), [Rent Something](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/rent-something), [VK Messenger](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/vk-messenger) and some others.

The next programming language I took up was Java. Simple games were made as training projects: [Bad Magic](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/bad-magic-game) and [Angry Dish](https://github.com/melihovv/angry-dish-game).

I also learned databases, algorithms, patterns, OOP, design and construction principles, version control systems, diagrams and more. Even tried myself in Assembler :)


Studying at university I developed a couple of projects I am proud of:  
My Bachelor thesis: [Interactive Timetable](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/interactive-timetable-for-autists) - app for Android device build using Xamarin framework. App is used in real life and helps children and adults.  
My Master thesis: [AR-Nav](https://github.com/petrenko-alex/ar-nav) - mobile application based on web technology stack. Combines a set of modern technologies and tools.  

üìÖ **2017 - 2021**  
  
From 2017 to 2021 I worked as a Middle Backend developer at [INTERVOLGA](https://github.com/intervolga).

Was focused on developing sites using Bitrix framework.  
I mostly worked on the development and support of online shops for small and medium-sized businesses.
Also had projects not related to e-commerce.  
I wrote articles, work on modules and internal company projects.  
As of 2020 I took part in the development of over 15 projects.

üìÖ **2021 - today**  
WIP. Come back soon...
